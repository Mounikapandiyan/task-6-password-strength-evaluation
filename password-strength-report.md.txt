 Common Password Attacks

	Brute Force Attack
			A brute force attack tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found. Short and simple passwords can be cracked quickly.

	Dictionary Attack
			A dictionary attack uses a predefined list of common words, names, and leaked passwords to guess credentials. Passwords containing names or common words are highly vulnerable.


Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
	Use a minimum of 12–16 characters
	Avoid using personal names or common words
	Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
	Avoid predictable patterns like 1234 or repeated numbers
	Use unique passwords for each account
	Prefer long passphrases or randomly generated passwords
